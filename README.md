## üéØ Project Overview
GesturePanda is a modern Windows-based Python application that uses your webcam and OpenCV to recognize dynamic hand gestures in real time and perform system actions such as play/pause media, scroll documents, adjust volume, and more.

---

## üîç Objective
Develop a real-time gesture recognition system that leverages a neural network to interpret hand gestures from webcam input and map them to system-level commands, enhancing user interaction and accessibility.

## üì¶ Functional Requirements
| Module   | Functionality                                                                 |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Module 1 | Capture live input from webcam and convert it to grayscale, filtered frames. |
| Module 2 | Track and detect hand region using motion detection and background subtraction. |
| Module 3 | Recognize gestures using trained neural network comparing with stored dataset. |
| Module 4 | Map recognized gesture to system command and execute it.                     |

## ‚úÖ Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Real-time operation with minimal latency (<150ms)
- **Usability:** Easy to start, minimal user calibration
- **Portability:** Windows 8 or higher; Webcam required
- **Extensibility:** Modular code to add more gestures easily
- **Accuracy:** >90% gesture recognition accuracy with stable lighting
